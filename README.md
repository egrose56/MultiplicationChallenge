# MultiplicationChallenge
HackingWithSwift-100 Days of SwiftUI-Day 35

I "completed" this challenge before reading the hints, so it doesn't really conform to some of the suggestions.  

I enjoyed the challenge but felt that the input into the TextField(s) was clunky as there was no way to clear the field programatically after the Submit.  I found a way to do a modifier with a back button online, but that was not exactly what I needed for good flow.  Maybe this is why the hints suggested creating the "questions" up front, but what about the answers?

Anyway, onward!
